### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jan. I live between Berlin and Caracas (currently the former) and I love data and its visualization. Here are some data projects I have been working on:

- [**Missing Migrants**](https://github.com/yotkadata/missing-migrants): Visualizing IOM data on people who went missing or lost their lives during migration
- [**MeteoHist**](https://github.com/yotkadata/meteo_hist): A Streamlit app to create temperature and precipitation graphs for places around the world
- [**Covid Waves**](https://github.com/yotkadata/covid-waves): A visualization of the spread of the novel Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 through Europe
