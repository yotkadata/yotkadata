### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jan. I live between Berlin and Caracas (currently the former) and I love data and its visualization. Here are some data projects I have been working on:

- [**Covid Waves**](https://github.com/yotkadata/covid-waves): A visualization of the spread of the novel Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 through Europe
- [**Renewable Electricity**](https://github.com/yotkadata/renewable-electricity): Visualizing Germany's (slow) transformation to renewable electricity
- [**Voter Turnouts**](https://github.com/yotkadata/voter-turnouts): Analyzing possible causes for declining voter turnout in Germany
